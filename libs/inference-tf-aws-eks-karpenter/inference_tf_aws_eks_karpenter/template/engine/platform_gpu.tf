# === GPU serving path ===
#
# The NVIDIA device plugin advertises GPUs as schedulable resources.
# Its image (and DCGM's) lives on nvcr.io with no no-creds mirror,
# so both are vendored into our ECR via CodeBuild (images_vendored.tf).
# Nodes pull the vendored copies from private ECR like any other image.

# GPU AMI cannot be selected by a Karpenter alias (no al2023-nvidia alias family);
# resolve the EKS-optimized AL2023 NVIDIA AMI ID from SSM and inject it into the
# gpu EC2NodeClass by id.
